# Sayaniku-Tweaks
Vanilla Tweaks optimizations with shaders and more, created with the fox love

I have decided to create my own pack of optimization, because a lot of pack doesn't work as well on some pc, they has a lot of optimization, an edited F3 menu
You had some resource pack by default, but they're aren't enabled by default
Shaders are compatible and custom pack from modrinth are avalable, Euphoria patch also has been added for both of the Complementary shaders
Essential is compatible and he's added already on the modpack, if you're playing with cracked player, I don't support that but I can understood why
